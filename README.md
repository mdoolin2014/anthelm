# Anthelminthic Project
Authors: M.L.Doolin and M.D.Dearing.
Institution: University of Utah

Using the fecal microbiome (16S data) to investigate microbiome changes in C57Bl/6 mice treated with different antiparasitic drugs

## Project design:
Animals housed in cages of 2–3, sexes distributed across treatment groups. Samples from pretreatment and after 7d of treatment with one of two antiparasitics or control group treated with autoclaved DI water. Seeing if antiparasitic drugs alone alter microbial community. Often used as deworming tools in projects monitoring parasite-microbiome interactions but drug effect is unaccounted for in experiment. 

## Labels:
- pretreat – samples before D1 of treatment
- D7 – samples after 7 days of treatment
- ALB – group treated with albendazole (broad spectrum anthelminthic)
- MTZ – group treated with metronidazole (broad spectrum antiprotozoal/antianaerobe)
- Control – group that was gavaved with only DI water

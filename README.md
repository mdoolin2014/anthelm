M.L. Doolin and M.D. Dearing. 2024. Differential effects of antiparasitics on the gut microbiome: Minimal impact of albendazole, depletions and then resilience with metronidazole. The Journal of Infectious Diseases 229(3):908–917. <https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiad547>

## Project design:
Mice were housed in cages of 2–3, sexes distributed across treatment groups. Sampled feces before treatment start, after 7 days of daily treatment, and then after a two-week recovery period. Characterized fecal microbiotas with 16S sequencing. Compared fecal micorbiota change between pretreatment and posttreatement, and separately compared post-recovery samples to one another due to different DNA extraction methods.  

Significance: Both drugs are often used as antiparasitic treatments of hosts suffering from gut parasitic diseases. Diseases can be exacerbated by gut microbial dysbiosis, and this study shows that metronidazole especially should be considered as causing dysbiosis from treatment. We encourage consideration of alternative treatments or support of microbiome health with probiotic supplements or prebiotic foods.
